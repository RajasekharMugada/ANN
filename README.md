## regression using keras 

## Project 1: regression_diamond_price

It is simple regression problem solved using sklearn and keras libraries. In this project an imaginary diamond price data is used to predict the prices. Numpy, pandas and seaborn libraries are used for data processing and visualization.

The project template can be used to solve any  regression problem we generally encounter.

## Project 2: regression_housing_price

It as an advanced regression problem involved 
  - Exploratory data analysis - finding how relavent the individual features are
  - feature engineering (dropping irrelevant features, converting date time strings)
  - Visualization
  - Model training and prediction

## Project 3: classification_cancer

It as a classification problem involved
  - correlation in the data to predict how good the model can be 
  - seaborn heatmap
  - Early stopping
  - Dropouts to solve overfitting problem


## Project 4: classification - lending club data

Sub set of lendingClub data has been used to demonstrate classification problem to predict loan repayment status
